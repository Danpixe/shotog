## 🌐 How shotog Works

shotog uses Cloudflare Workers to handle image generation close to your users, speeding up delivery. Behind the scenes, it uses technologies like Satori and Hono to create SVG and PNG images based on your input. The end result is an image that appears every time a link is shared on social media or embedded in meta tags.

You send a request to shotog’s API with details about the image you want, and you get an image back. This process runs in the cloud, so your computer only needs to send the request and receive the result.
